<h3 align='center'>Introduction to frappe</h3>

<p align="justify">Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.</p>
**Why Frappe?
<p align="justify">The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.</p>

- Install Frappe-bench and its required tool. For more info [Click here](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/installation).

<h3 align='center'>Introduction to budibase</h3>

Budibase is an all-in-one low-code platform for building, designing, and automating business apps, such as; admin panels, forms, internal tools, client portals, and more. Before Budibase, it could take developers weeks to build simple CRUD apps; with Budibase, building CRUD apps takes minutes.

**Why Budibase ?**

Today i am installing docker for hosting app in budibase .It is successfully installed. But i got error during 'setting up budibase'.Not solved yet. I follow "https://github.com/Budibase/docs/tree/master/self-hosting" .

<h3 align='center'>Introduction to Docker, Virtual Machine </h3>

**What is Docker?**
<p align="justify">Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.Docker Containers are Light-weight, Applications run in isolation,Occupies less space, Easily portable and highly secure, Short boot-up
time.</p>
- It can run multiple containers on a system.
- It can start multiple containers at a time on the Docker engine.
<br>

**What is Virtual Machine?**
<p align="justify">A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.</p>
- It can start only a single VM on a VMX.
- It can run only a limited number of VMs on a system.

Install Budibase - Use Budibase Cloud to get started in seconds, or self-host your apps using Docker, Kubernetes , or DigitalOcean.
Add data - You can connect to data sources like PostgreSQL, Rest APIs, MS SQL, MySQL and more, or start from scratch with Budibase's built-in database (Budibase DB, built on top of CouchDB).
Design your UI - Build beautiful, accessible user interfaces people enjoy using. Autogenerate CRUD screens from your data, or create custom screens from scratch. Use powerful components, such as tables, buttons, form inputs, to enrich your interface. Switch from light mode to dark mode with just a click.
Automate processes - In seconds, setup automations such as email alerts, Slack notifications, CRON actions, and more.</p>

<h3 align='center'>Working on Job portal app in budibase</h3>
if you want to access a budibase app without login, you will need to make some "Public" screens, and browse directly to the URL for those screens.

You will also need to make sure that your public screens are only accessing tables/queries that have "Public" access. Beware that this will mean that all data in those tables will be public (if "Read" is set to Public).
And I successfully make all screens public.
I checked how all pages are created in job portal app. How it to be published.

<h3 align='center'>Introdution to TMUX and Mosh</h3>
<p align="justify">Today we were working on education domain in erpnext and trying to understand the student module of education domain. Today we got to know two new tools which are really very helpful for the coders which are TMUX and MOSH. Mosh: Mosh is free and command-line software that is used to connect from a client computer to a server over the Internet to run a remote terminal. Mosh is more intelligent than SSH. While the SSH client waits for a TCP response from the server before showing your typing, Mosh will display your typing in real-time and even give underlined typing predictions. The mosh program will SSH to user@host to establish the connection. As you know, SSH may prompt the user for a password or use public-key authentication to log in. But mosh runs the mosh-server process (as the user) on the server machine. Mosh will run inside your Terminals such as xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, Terminal.app, iTerm, emacs, screen, or tmux.
Tmux: Tmux is a Linux application that allows multitasking in a terminal window. It stands for Terminal Multiplexing, and is based around sessions. Users can start a process, switch to a new one, detach from a running process, and reattach to a running process.</p>

For example, if the assessment was conducted for english or other subject, then we canevaluate Student in English on various criteria like Writing, internal assessment(viva), Attendence etc.Assessment criteria can be used while scheduling assessment plan for
student group and course.
Then next , I have created Assessment group tree (hierarchy for examination conducted in school) for one batch i.e 2021-2022 . As shown in following screenshot.
**Assessment plan**

Next I created Assessment plan which is schedule to conduct the examination/assessment of a particular course for a group of students in an on-going academic term. For creating Assessment plan the prerequisites is grading scale so, we need to create grading scale for it.

Grading Scale

Grading scale define the threshold for the different grades obtained by the students, based on their scores in the assessment. For example , I have created grading scale of Students obtaining a score of 100%  would be graded as O, students obtaining a score of 80% and below would be graded A- and so on.
After creating Assessment plan for course 'English-4/A/MST -1'. Then
there is Assessment Result.

Assessment Result

Assessment Result is log of marks/grades earned by the student for
specific Assessment. Basically we can use Assessment Result Tool for
creating log of marks of multiple students at the same time . It is
based on Assessment plan.

Today we all have explored learning management system in erpnext too "https://gne11.gndec.ac.in/lms" which is basically student interface. I was also working on emails basically "how we can disable email must be unique" in erpnext and I have found a solution for this problem for this we have to open the doctype and to click on customize doctype and then go to email field type then click on edit in full page there is an checkbox named "Unique" then just uncheck it.

<h3 align='center'>Gunicorn, Socket.io, Scaffhold</h3>
<p align="justify">Today we got to know three new terms that are used in frappe first is Gunicorn:-Gunicorn is built so many different web servers can interact with it. It also does not really care what you used to build your web application - as long as it can be interacted with using the WSGI interface.Gunicorn takes care of everything which happens in-between the web server and your web application.

Socket.io:-Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server. It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

Scaffhold:-Scaffolding is a meta-programming method of building database-backed software applications. It is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks, in which the programmer may write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. The compiler uses this specification to generate code that the application can use to create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.</p>
