This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.</p>

<h3 align='center'>Working on Job portal app in budibase</h3>
Today I finding how we can make public screens.

if you want to access a budibase app without login, you will need to make some "Public" screens, and browse directly to the URL for those screens.

You will also need to make sure that your public screens are only accessing tables/queries that have "Public" access. Beware that this will mean that all data in those tables will be public (if "Read" is set to Public).
And I successfully make all screens public.
